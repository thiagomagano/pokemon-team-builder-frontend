# Pokemon Team Builder

A simple app to train my full-stack development skills.

### About the app

This app is a pokemon team builder, the title is already very explanatory üòù.
The main objective is to select up to 6 pokemons to assemble an ideal team, exploring pokemons strengths and weaknesses based on their types.
You will be able to save your teams and then consult Anytime you want.

### The Pokemon Battle System

It's a system similar to the game **"Rock, Paper and Scissors"** but much more complex and intense. In "Rock, Paper and Scissors" there are only **3 types** to memorize.
In Pokemon there are **18 types** and they can be related in **4 different intensities** ([Check the relationship between types of Pokemon here](https://pokemondb.net/type)), So for coming out as a winner takes a lot of memory effort! That's why **POKEMON TEAM BUILDER** can help you.

## Demo

## Tech Stack

#### Frontend 

- **React**: Library to make reusable components
- **CSS**: Only CSS Vanilla to add some layouts and styles to the components
- **Axios**: Handle HTTP requests, connect to the API
- **React-Router-Dom**: Handle app navigation and protected routes
- **React-Hot-Toast**: Notifications and feedbacks to the user
- **Vite**: Initial boilerplate and  builder to deployment

#### Backend

- **Node**: Server side Javascript runtime
- **Typescript**: Handle types
- **Express**: Framework to easy handle https method calls
- **REST API**: API architecture style
- **Prisma**:ORM to easy handle database model, schemas, migrations and data seeding
- **Postgress**: SQL database to store app informations

#### Other:

- **GIT**: Track the state of the codebase
- **Github**: Local to store the repository
- **Notion**: Track the project roadmap and features
- **Insomnia**: To test API calls
- **Heroku**: To deploy app backend using CLI tools
- **Vercel**: To deploy app frontend


## Lessons Learned

#### General Learned

- With the development of this application I was able to understand a lot how the "**trial and error**" learning method works.
It's actually quite satisfying after hours of racking your brains to find an ideal **solution to the problem**.

- I also learned to read a lot the **documentation** of languages and libraries to implement some features
 
- And of course a lot of **Google** and **Stackoverflow** to fix some bugs

#### Tech Learned

- How powerful the **Prisma** tool can be, because I could modify the database schema very easily, type the models easily and quickly.

- **Data Modeling** using **Typescript**

- **Async Javascript** to handle http requests

- **REST API** consumption both in the backend to **seed** database, and to get data from other applications in the frontend

- **React Context API** to share states between application components.

- How to create registration and login methods using **localstorage** and retrive data from database.

- Various uses of **CSS GRID** and **FLEXBOX** as powerful ways to create responsive layouts using few lines of code

- Use the **REACT-HOT-TOAST** library to create amazing notifications

- Use **React-Router-Dom V6** to create protected routes

- create **React Custom Hooks** to easy handle authentication

- how to deploy an application right from the command line and how to access the machine directly in the cloud with **HEROKU**
- how easy it is to deploy a frontend application using **Vercel**

## Improvements

I am aware that it is necessary to add code in the future to make it cleaner and more organized, for this I intend to implement some methods in the future:

- [ ] Tests
- [ ] CSS Architeture
- [ ] MVC to the  REST API
- [ ] SOLID principles
- [ ] Typescript with React

## Next Features

The next upgrades to the app
 
 - [ ] Handle Delete Teams
 - [ ] Handle update of Pokemons in a team 
 - [ ] Random Team Generation
